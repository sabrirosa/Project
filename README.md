Collaborative Project Management System

//Draft
Define requirements and requisites: Identifying the essential requirements and functionality of the collaborative project management system. This can include features such as creating projects, assigning tasks, tracking progress, sharing documents, and communicating between team members.
Structure: Plan the data structure needed to store information on projects, tasks, team members, and other relevant data. This might involve creating classes like Project, Task, Team, Member, and so on, along with their relationships.
Server development: Create a server application using Java to manage business logic and database interaction. Use a web framework like Spring or Java EE for easy development. Implement core functionality such as project creation, task assignment, team member communication, and progress tracking.
Client Development: Develop a client application using Java to provide a user-friendly interface. This can be done using a GUI framework such as JavaFX or Swing. Create screens to allow users to access and interact with system functionality, such as creating projects, managing tasks, and collaborating with other team members.
Database Integration: Use a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store project management system data. Create the necessary tables to store information on projects, tasks, team members, etc. Use a data persistence library such as Hibernate or JPA to facilitate interaction between the Java application and the database.
Testing: Carry out rigorous testing of all system functionality to ensure it is working properly. This includes unit tests for each class and method, integration tests to verify correct interaction between components, and usability tests to ensure a proper user experience.
Deployment: Prepare the project management system for deployment in a production environment. This might involve setting up an application server, creating a database in production, and configuring proper security.
